# Planet Link React Website

Welcome to the Planet Link React website! This website was built using Vite and React, and it uses MongoDB Atlas as a database. The website fetches data from an Express server that is hosted on https://planet-link-api.onrender.com.

## Run locally

To run the application locally follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/teriola/planet-link.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Run the website:

```
npm run dev
```

This will most likely start a development server at `http://localhost:5173/` but it will show you where it is started anyways.

## Deployment

The website is hosted on Vercel at https://planet-link.vercel.app/

## API server

The API server for the website is hosted on https://planet-link-api.onrender.com/
The source code for the server is available at https://github.com/teriola/planet-link-api
